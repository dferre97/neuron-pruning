# TODO List for Neuron Pruning Project

## General Tasks
- [X] Check weights, biases, and scores initialization
- [ ] Understand best scores initialization for neuron pruning (can't directly apply Kaiming uniform as in Ramanujan)
- [ ] Check implementation to fully understand if gradients are updated the way I think they are
